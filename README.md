Contributors: lindseymardona, jbfranco21, ryansuwarno

## The Task
Our goal is to aid in exploratory analysis of the Million Songs Dataset through visualizations of the data.

## The Dataset
The Million Song Dataset (MSD) is a collection of 1,000,000 contemporary, popular music tracks with their associated audio features and metadata. The songs are mostly of western origina and release years range from 1922 to 2011, with a peak in songs from the 2000s. 

"Detailed description of the demo file. This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.

## Installations
"Instructions on how to install the package requirements. If you used the conda line above, your instruction should have the line conda create --name NEWENV --file requirements.txt."

## Scope and Limitations
Scope and limitations, including ethical implications, accessibility concerns, and ideas for potential extensions.
