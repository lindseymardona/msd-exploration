## The Task
Our goal is to aid in exploratory analysis of the Million Songs Dataset through visualizations of the data. There are two classes which assist us in doing so:
- data_visuals_class: This class streamlines the visualization process to compare and/or analyze columns from the dataset.
- ArtistSummary: This class streamlines the process to summarize some general information about the artist and their songs.

## The Dataset
The Million Song Dataset (MSD) is a collection of 1,000,000 contemporary, popular music tracks with their associated audio features and metadata. The songs are mostly of western origina and release years range from 1922 to 2011, with a peak in songs from the 2000s. The dataset used is a subset of the Million Song dataset, with 10,000 tracks.

### Track Information:
Each track description includes the following:
  - **SongNumber** - Number associated with the order in which the song appears in the dataset
  - **SongID** - The Echo Nest song ID
  - **AlbumID** - The Echo Nest album ID
  - **AlbumName** - Name of the Album
  - **ArtistID** - The ID of the artist accorrding to playme.com
  - **ArtistName** - Artist Name
  - **Danceability** - Danceability measure of the song according to The Echo Nest
  - **Duration** - Duration of the song track
  - **KeySignature** - Estimation of the key of the song according to The Echo Nest
  - **Tempo** - Tempo in BPM according to The Echo Nest
  - **TimeSignature** - Time signature of song according to The Echo nest (beats per minute)
  - **Title** - Song Title
  - **Year** - Year when the song was released, according to musicbrainz.org
  - **SongHotness** - According to The Echo Nest, the hotness of the song when downloaded (scale of 0 to 1)

## Installations
The users should pip install the requirements.txt
```
conda create --name msdenv --file requirements.txt
```
or
```
conda create --name msdenv 
conda install pip
pip instal -r requirements.txt
```

## Scope and Limitations
While data cleaning, certain songs were removed due to special characters within the album or track titles. Due to this, the dataset is composed of mainly Western music and various tracks from the early 2000's. Also due to the data cleaning of tracks with missing data, the dataset may be heavily skewed to more popular or well-known tracks or artists.

Scope and limitations, including ethical implications, accessibility concerns, and ideas for potential extensions.

## Description of the demo file
"Detailed description of the demo file. This includes detailed instructions on how to run it, what output one should expect to see, and any explanations or interpretations of the result. There should be at least 2 figures embedded in this section. It can be screenshots of your game, or plots generated by your data visualization code. Make sure these figures have appropriate titles and captions, and are sufficiently explained in your text.
....

The csv. file used was a randomly chosen subset of the Million Song Dataset. The file included 10,000 tracks in total, but required data cleaning to remove unnecessary columns and tracks with missing data. 

### Data Visualization
We import several modules to gain access to the code in another module. urllib is a package that collects several modules for working with URLs. Pandas is a package that tells Python to bring the pandas data analysis library into your current environment. Numpy is a package to perform a number of mathematical operations on arrays such as trigonometric, statistical, and algebraic routines. Matplotlib.pyplot is a package to generate Pyplot such as Line Plot, Contour, Histogram, Scatter, 3D Plot, etc.

We import code from data_visual_class.py to get the graph_visuals function. First of all we called the data set that we have already cleaned into the Dataset visualization file. Then, we assign axis strings with axis titles to each variable that we are using. Some tracks are missing values for certain columns. Throughout the visualizations, we will be removing any unknown values for certain columns for proper scatter plot, bar graph, or box plot visualizations.

#### I. Durations vs Tempo

We removed all rows that have 0 values for durations and tempo. We decided to use scatter plotto give us the data correlation between the durations and the tempo of the millions data set. From the result, the information we received is that most song durations are between 200 to 275 seconds, while most songs' tempo is between 80 to 130 beats per minute.

We generated boxplot for tempo and durations to get more clearer view of the data

From the “tempo” box plot above, we could see that most songs’ tempo were between 95 to 145 beats per minute, with the median around 120 beats per minute

From the “duration” box plot above, we could see that most songs' duration were between 180 to 275 seconds, with the median around 210 seconds.
